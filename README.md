# Broadcast Web Frontend

Using Zoom's new [Video SDK](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/sdk/video/introduction), (a no UI, video, audio, screenshare, chat, and data channel as a service SDK), I built a web app where you can livestream from the web to [Amazon IVS](https://aws.amazon.com/ivs/). Combining the most powerful Video and Livestream platforms, this web app allows you to stream from anywhere, and distribute the stream at scale and in high definition.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
